# Ruby Web Server Example

This repository contains an example of a web server written "from scratch" in Ruby. It is built up through a series of Pull Requests in order to demonstrate just how simple the creation of a web server can be!

To run this program, type the following command in your terminal:

```sh
ruby web_server.rb
```

You can then visit it at http://127.0.0.1:8000

To stop the server, press CTRL-C in your terminal.
